**Standard Deviation** is a number that describes how spread out the values are.

A low standard deviation means that most of the numbers are close to the mean (average) value.

A high standard deviation means that the values are spread out over a wider range.

**Variance** is a related value that also indicates how spread out the values are.  The square root of the variance gives you the standard deviation, and so multiplying the standard deviation by itself gives you the variance.
